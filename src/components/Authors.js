      <h2> Best Action/Adventure Authors </h2>
      <p>
        Miguel de Cervantes This Spanish author is most famous for writing Don
        Quixote, a work of literature has been considered one of the all time
        greats since it was first published in 1605, and 1615. It’s surprisingly
        got an almost postmodern dimension, as the second part of the novel
        references people who have read the first half (self referential). It
        tells the tale of a man who becomes interested in chivalric books, and
        gets lost in them to the extent that he decides to become a
        knight-errant himself, and sets out to save ladies who need saving and
        tilt at windmills.

        Joseph Conrad Most famous for Heart of Darkness which is a darker tale,
        exploring the horrors of colonialism in Africa in the 19th Century. Not
        all action and adventure stories are fun, and tongue in cheek, like the
        novel above. This story features particularly strong characterisation,
        especially in the form of the character ‘Kurtz’, who is an ivory trader
        for a dodgy Belgian company. Conrad is considered one of the great
        writers of the English language, so this one is a must read if you can
        handle a darker tale!

      <h2>Speculative Fiction</h2>

        Ursula K. Le Guin Ursula Kroeber Le Guin (1929 – 2018) was an American
        author who wrote speculative fiction set in her own Hainish universe,
        and also wrote the Earthsea fantasy series. She wrote for sixty years,
        including over twenty novels and a vast number of short stories. Le
        Guin’s work was richly influenced by multiple philosophical traditions
        includng anthropology, feminism, Jung, and anthropology. If you’re
        looking for genre writing that gets the mental juices flowing then
        Ursula is certainly for you!

      <h2>Contemporary Issues Authors</h2>
      <p>
        Mary H.K. Choi Choi’s novels usually get classed as YA, but they
        actually take place in the space that falls just outside the reach of
        that label, into the arena of the twenty something year old trying to
        gain a foothold in the big wide world. Her writing occasionally deals
        with difficult issues like eating disorders.

        Colleen Hoover Hoover has sold over 20 million copies, with her books
        often being self published before being transferred over to a
        traditional publisher. She has previously held six of the ten New York
        Times Paper Best Selling Fiction spots at the same time. Wow! She has
        worked as a social worker, which may have helped to add to depth and
        reality to her plots which address areas like home-schooling and more
        difficult areas like domestic violence. She is currently regarded as on
        the most successful authors in any genre, and appears to be taking the
        literary world by storm!
